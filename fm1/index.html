          William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616) was an
          English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest
          writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.
          He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". "
          His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately
          39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other
          verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated
          into every major living language <br> and are performed more often than
          those of any other playwnight. <br> <br>

          Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
          Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway,
          wittfilhhom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and
          Judith, Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career
          in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company
          called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At
          age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where
          he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life
          survive, this has stimulated considerable speculation about such
          matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious
          beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by
          others. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately
          note that few records survive of most commoners <br> of the period. <br> <br>

          Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.
          His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are
          regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until
          about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello,
          King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works
          in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote
          tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other
          playwrights. <br> <br>

          Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying
          quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow
          actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry
          Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio,
          a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that
          included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a
          poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in
          a now-famous quote <br> as "not of an age, but for all time" <br> <br>

          Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have
          been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in
          scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are
          studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various <br> cultural and
          political contexts around the world. <br> <br>
